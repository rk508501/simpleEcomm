# Shop Simple Joy

## Architecture & Know-how

This project is a modern web application built with:

- **Vite** (build tool)
- **TypeScript** (type-safe JavaScript)
- **React** (UI library)
- **shadcn-ui** (UI components)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework)

The codebase is organized as follows:

- `src/` contains all source code
  - `components/` for reusable UI components
  - `contexts/` for React context providers (e.g., cart)
  - `data/` for static data (e.g., products)
  - `hooks/` for custom React hooks
  - `lib/` for utility functions
  - `pages/` for main app pages (Cart, Checkout, Products, etc.)

Configuration files for TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, and ESLint are in the project root.
